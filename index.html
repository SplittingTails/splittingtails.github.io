    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>

      <p>My interest in IT is mainly the server/networking side with alittle bit of web design on the side, I first got interesting in I.T When my dad bought home a intel pentium 2 and i started using ICQ and playing the sims and abs odessy and slowly bilt in to the house hold I.T support person and helping friends and family with printing and browser viewing issue, i then did some I.T classes in high school and finaly got in to the I.T field. I am now working as a System analyst/systems engineer for a small compnay, I orignaly started out as a level 1 support technician and was promoted to a level 2 systems engineer then i decided to take on another challange with start a small side business designing small web sites and fixing consumers computer issues. I now work as a System analyst/systems engineer for a small company my main tasks are help desk support, maintaining sharepoint, creating sql querys for reports and our phone systems. </p>
        
      <p>I orgianlly applied for la trobe uni as it was close to my house but found out that they do not hold night class or online class and found la trobes enrollment process very unhelpful and confusing, OUA/RMIT was much easier and the staff were alot more helpful and i beleieve rmit are known more for there information technology courses.</p>
        
      <p> I would like to further improve my I.T skill beyond being just an I.T technican, I would like to be designing networkings and I.T infurstructure or maybe even be a lead/manger on client I.T projects having more of an impact on the solution and not just maintaning or troubleshooting minor issues. I would also like to learn more about the software development side of I.T as I have not had much experiance programing. </p>

            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            
            <p>The reaults to these test's was abit surprising to me as i always saw myself as an intervert and the 16 personalities test shows that i am an extravert and that i need to work with hands on projects, things like learning coding by doing instead of just reading a book or watching a video about then subject. the thired test shows that i work well in a team but not as a leader and need some direction before starting a new idea.</p>
            
            <p>After doing these 3 tests i believe i need to speak up for about my ideas in a team and not just do what the group agrees to just to save from having an argument or a conflict, i believe that i would wwork best in a smaller team then a larger team as i like to get to know my team members before trusting them, I would also benafit from having team member that are not like me and have a more visual and adiable approach to a problem.</p>
            
            <p>With the results from these test i would look for team members that are good at taking the lead on a project but also allow me to use my skills and idea's to create something that i think is meaningful to work on. i would also look for team members that i can trust and can help me with areas that i lack in.</p>
