    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>

      <p>My interest in IT is mainly the server/networking side with alittle bit of web design on the side, I first got interesting in I.T When my dad bought home a intel pentium 2 and i started using ICQ and playing the sims and abs odessy and slowly bilt in to the house hold I.T support person and helping friends and family with printing and browser viewing issue, i then did some I.T classes in high school and finaly got in to the I.T field. I am now working as a System analyst/systems engineer for a small compnay, I orignaly started out as a level 1 support technician and was promoted to a level 2 systems engineer then i decided to take on another challange with start a small side business designing small web sites and fixing consumers computer issues. I now work as a System analyst/systems engineer for a small company my main tasks are help desk support, maintaining sharepoint, creating sql querys for reports and our phone systems. </p>
        
      <p>I orgianlly applied for la trobe uni as it was close to my house but found out that they do not hold night class or online class and found la trobes enrollment process very unhelpful and confusing, OUA/RMIT was much easier and the staff were alot more helpful and i beleieve rmit are known more for there information technology courses.</p>
        
      <p> I would like to further improve my I.T skill beyond being just an I.T technican, I would like to be designing networkings and I.T infurstructure or maybe even be a lead/manger on client I.T projects having more of an impact on the solution and not just maintaning or troubleshooting minor issues. I would also like to learn more about the software development side of I.T as I have not had much experiance programing. </p>

            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            
            <p>The reaults to these test's was abit surprising to me as i always saw myself as an intervert and the 16 personalities test shows that i am an extravert and that i need to work with hands on projects, things like learning coding by doing instead of just reading a book or watching a video about then subject. the thired test shows that i work well in a team but not as a leader and need some direction before starting a new idea.</p>
            
            <p>After doing these 3 tests i believe i need to speak up for about my ideas in a team and not just do what the group agrees to just to save from having an argument or a conflict, i believe that i would wwork best in a smaller team then a larger team as i like to get to know my team members before trusting them, I would also benafit from having team member that are not like me and have a more visual and adiable approach to a problem.</p>
            
            <p>With the results from these test i would look for team members that are good at taking the lead on a project but also allow me to use my skills and idea's to create something that i think is meaningful to work on. i would also look for team members that i can trust and can help me with areas that i lack in.</p>

                <h2>Project Idea</h2>
                
                <p>My project would be a medical device that would help users not have to go to there GP for a General checkup and have to wait for hours to see a doctor, to solve this issue i would be developing a smart watch that could help with the most basic and day to day medical exams by having bio medical hardware sensors and software developed to store the data in to an encrypted private database in the cloud that you could send to your chosen doctor to review and if your doctor needs to follow up with you because of any concern he can schedule you an appointment. </p>
                
                <p>I believe this device would be useful for freeing up general practitioners clients for more urgent emergency's and to help people that have difficulties travelling to a GP for a basic checkup. The device would also alert people to any issues they are having with there bodies before the health issue is unmanageable or fatal, this could save many lives and would not cost much more then the most expensive sports smart watches and could even be medically subsidised by the government health system to lower costs for low income earners and for elderly patients this could be developed in to a house hold item with easier to understand instructions similar to google assistant for phone and google home for your house. </p>
                
                
                <p>The features of the smart watch would include all the general health checks such as, Height / weight checker to check that the user is not overweight for there height which could lead to type 2 diabetes or heart disease and strokes, Blood pressure checker to check for any heart disease, Cholesterol level checker to check the users liver is working correctly and reduce heart attacks and strokes, Blood sugar test to test for diabetes, Throat and ear check to check for any inflammation or infection and to take your temperature, Eye checker to check your eyes are reacting to light correctly and for any signs of infection or lumps, The last two feature will only be available from the home unit an Electrocardiogram (ECG) to further check for irregular heat beats and heart disease and a Chest x-ray to check lungs and other internal organs the software will run on android so that the software can be downloaded on any smart device but to use all the features and advanced features you will need to buy both the home unit and smart device E.G smartwatch.</p>

                <p>The back end of the software will be a service that connects to a database stored in the cloud so that GP clinics can op in to the service and receive the data from the user device in to the patients medical history file there would need to be a lot of encryption and security on the database and the cloud server would need to be stored in a top security server farm. The GP clinic could then review the results of the data and notify the user if they are at risk of any health issues and the user could then make an appointment to see there GP when it is convent for them or make transport plans ahead of time.</p>
                
                <p>Bruce Japsen suggests that some patients are waiting up to 24 days before seeing a doctor which is way to long to be waiting to see a doctor which is where my device would save people having to see a doctor if they don’t need to and free up the queue for people that do. </p>
                
                <p>Some drawbacks may include the price to purchase all the features and make the device available to all users, to make the device small enough to fit on your wrist and all the costs to keep the servers running to make this all affordable we would need to use open source software which is free and customizable but this my cause some security concerns for some people and would make supporting the software and servers a lot more challenging.</p>
